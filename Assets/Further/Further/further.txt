This mesh was designed by Kerstin von Gabain for the exhibition "Access to tools" in transforming freedom at the Quartier 21 (Vienna) http://www.transformingfreedom.org . Model Design by Marcus Hinterthuer.This really isn't all that good for those of you who need drop objects. It's a low-poly modeling (less details, Marcus pfushed at the boiler, too lazy!) of the Merry-Pranksters-Acid test-Bus "further/furthur/furthr". It's not highly detailed, but gives the impression of what I was looking for. However, I think Marcus did something to it so it may not go exactly as planned (he hasn't had time to go back and fix it).All files were created in 3dMAX and saved in .3ds or .objUsage Guidelines:This model is free for only personal use in your projects.For commercial use, I ask that you notify me (mail(at)kerstinvongabain.com)about the project that it is being used for, and that you give Marcus Hinterthuer (bongo_joe(at)hotmail.com) credit for the modeling in whatever credits or documentation that accompany it.Sale of this model by itself, or as part of a collection is strictly prohibited.Enjoy
